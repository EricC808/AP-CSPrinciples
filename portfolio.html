    <h1>   Project #1</h1>
    <h1>   For my first project what my group and I did was make a ice cream maker. The code prints how many scoops would they like and the user can type how many scoops they want. After they say how many scoops they want, the code will ask the user which flavors they would like from what flavors we have on the menu. Then it will draw the cone and how many scoops they want with the flavor that they chose for each scoop and each flavor has its own unique outline color. After it draws the amount of scoops they want it will put a cherry on the very top scoop of the ice cream cone.</h1>

    <h1>   Project #2</h1>
    <h1>   For my 2nd project my group and i made a variation of the popular mobile game fruit ninja. The code of our project puts the three fruits at the top of the screen when the fruits are shown the timer at the top left. The user has 20 seconds to click on the fruit to get the best score possible. Once the 20 second timer at the top ends it will show a screen saying thank you for playing and display your final score at the top right.</h1>

    <h1>   Project #3</h1>
    <h1>   For my 3rd project we did it scratch this time and what my partner and i made was a adaptation of the popular game snake. What our code does for our scratch project is when you click the green flag it starts the game. Then it will switch to the game background from the starting screen. When it switches backgrounds the snake will ask for your name then you will type it and press enter to start the game. To move the snake you can use the arrow keys to go up down left and right, and to increase your score you need to touch apple with the snake then the apple will move to a random location when touched.

    <h1>   3.1.6 Rover Data Project</h1>
    <h1>   What we did to conclude from the data and get Desert Plains is that we first split up the data into 4 groups by how the data looked with how many digits there were, then we made graphs for each of the columns of data. Then we looked at the planet conditions and compared it to the 4 graphs. We used a process of elimination to figure out which planet it is we first took out low and constant since nothing was low for movement. Then after that we took out low for sound since there was nothing that was low for that sensor that matched.After doing all of that we came up with our answer which was Desert Plains.</h1>
