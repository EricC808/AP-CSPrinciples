    <h1>   Project #1.</h1>
    <h1>   For my first project what my group and I did was make a ice cream maker. The code prints how many scoops would they like and the user can type how many scoops they want. After they say how many scoops they want, the code will ask the user which flavors they would like from what flavors we have on the menu. Then it will draw the cone and how many scoops they want with the flavor that they chose for each scoop and each flavor has its own unique outline color. After it draws the amount of scoops they want it will put a cherry on the very top scoop of the ice cream cone.</h1>

    <h1>   Project #2.</h1>
    <h1>   For my 2nd project my group and i made a variation of the popular mobile game fruit ninja. The code of our project puts the three fruits at the top of the screen when the fruits are shown the timer at the top left. The user has 20 seconds to click on the fruit to get the best score possible. Once the 20 second timer at the top ends it will show a screen saying thank you for playing and display your final score at the top right.</h1>
