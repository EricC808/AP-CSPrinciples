    <h1>   Project #1.</h1>
    <h1>   For my first project what my group and I did was make a ice cream maker. The code prints how many scoops would they like adn the user can type how many scoops they want. After they say how many scoops they want, the code will ask the user which flavors they would like from what flavors we have on the menu. Then it will draw the cone adn how many scoosp they want with the flavor that they chose for each scoop and each falvor has its own unique outline color. After it draws the amount of scoops they want it will put a cherry on the very top scoop of the ice cream cone.</h1>
